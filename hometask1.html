            <h4>Basket Ball</h4><br>
            <p>Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world and one of the most widely viewed.
                 It is a team sport that involves two teams of five active players each trying to score points 
                 against one another by throwing a ball through a 300 cm (10 feet) high hoop (the ‘basket’) under organised rules.
                  It is played on both indoor and outdoor courts.The size of the court, height of the basket, size of the basketball, 
                  and length of time that the game is played, can all vary according to the age, size and skill level of players.
             Basketball is a fast moving game that involves a lot of variety, including shooting, dribbling, passing,
              rebounding, defence and much more.</p><br>

            <h4>Cricket</h4><br>
            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)
                 pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the 
                 ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to
                  prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter
                   (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by 
                   the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with 
                   the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends 
                   and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international 
                   matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

            <h4>Tennis</h4><br>
            <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players 
                each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or 
                around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not 
                able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
